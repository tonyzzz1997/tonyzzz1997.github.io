        <p>Thanks to creative minds like Tom Ford and Alessandro Michele, Gucci has regularly gone out on a limb with its designs and styles and taken a chance. The brand has often caused a stir with its outlandish creations. For shoe fans of the label,
            I’m shifting the focus down a notch. Shoes are not excluded. With the daring designs you draw all eyes on you and is certainly not overlooked. An example of a currently super popular shoe model of the brand is the Flashtrek Gucci sneaker.
            With this design the label has interpreted the Ugly Sneaker trend for itself. Chunky shoe models with eye-catching decorations immediately catch the eye and are a real eye-catcher. The new shoe trends are thick platform soles and high heels.
            So walking will be a little more difficult for Gucci lovers in the future! However, the absolute hit of the last few years was the loafer model. This has been reinterpreted by designer Michele this season. So the trend is moving away from
            classic designs and towards flashy colors, stones, glitter and thick soles. The designer has created a rebel of the classic Gucci shoe. The new creation is much rockier and can no longer be compared to the classic model! Shoes with integrated
            socks also enjoy special popularity among customers from all over the world. Extravagance is therefore guaranteed, but whether the hype will last permanently on the feet of fans is still questionable.</p>
