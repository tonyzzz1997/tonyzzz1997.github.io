        <p>Kanye West is much like an 18th-century pirate. Bear with me with this one. Similar traits include: being unafraid to jump ship (moving from Nike to Adidas in 2013), having a completely unapologetic attitude to life (just look at his Twitter account),
            taking shots at enemies (eg.Taylor Swift) and having a knack for collecting gold (212 awards under his belt and counting). So if Kanye is the modern-day Blackbeard, then what is his booty? No, not Kim. It’s his Adidas x Yeezy sneakers of course.
            And the holy grail of the treasure? The Yeezy Boost 350. A decade-defining sneaker, the Yeezy Boost 350 is Kanye West and Adidas most successful silhouette. Why? Because not only do the sneakers look as fresh with gym gear as they do with
            date-night attire, they’re also insanely comfortable. (find out just how comfortable they are here). This is down to the use of Adidas’ innovative materials, a primeknit upper upon a Boost sole. But where did it all begin and where is it heading
            next? With the help of Fresco Wilson, manager and official Youtube 'unboxer' of Stadium Goods, we put together a timeline of the Yeezy Boost 350 - a sneaker sure to go down in history as one of the all-time greats.</p>
